#Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Feed

This project studies ways to estimate sentiment for short, incomplete text snippets. 
Sentiment is defined as "an attitude, thought, or judgment prompted by feeling." 
Our specific goal is a visualization that presents basic emotional properties embodied in the text, together with a measure of the confidence in our estimates.

##Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining)

refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in source materials.
Generally speaking, sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker or a writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. 
The attitude may be his or her judgment or evaluation, affective state (that is to say, the emotional state of the author when writing), or the intended emotional communication 
(that is to say, the emotional effect the author wishes to have on the reader).

##Stanford CoreNLP
provides a set of natural language analysis tools which can take raw text input and give the base forms of words, their parts of speech, whether they are names of companies, people, etc., 
normalize dates, times, and numeric quantities, and mark up the structure of sentences in terms of phrases and word dependencies, indicate which noun phrases refer to the same entities, indicate sentiment, etc. 

Stanford CoreNLP is an integrated framework. Its goal is to make it very easy to apply a bunch of linguistic analysis tools to a piece of text. Starting from plain text, you can run all the tools on it with just two lines of code. 
It is designed to be highly flexible and extensible. With a single option you can change which tools should be enabled and which should be disabled. 
Its analyses provide the foundational building blocks for higher-level and domain-specific text understanding applications.
